### What it does
As we understand that Fast-Food chain restaurant is well-know for everyone because the food is delicious and cheap. However, People were often misunderstood that how much nutrition value does each food has, and maybe sometimes people who is trying to lose weight, but still carving for fast food. Throughout my project about food Nutrition acorss some popular fast-food restaurants, I have collected showed the top 4 fast-food restaurants nutrition facts, used data cleaning and data extraction to ensure each data has unique value with its rows and columsn. More importantly, I have utilized Pandas and Streamlit to demonstrate high protein, high carbohydrates, and high sugars. By looking at the results, it helps customers to make their smart decisions when they are trying to be healthy at the same time.

### How you run my project
Throughout this project I was heavily rely on Pandas and Streamlit. I used a lot of read_pdf and read_csv to read my different dataset, and then I convert it to the dataframe. After convert to the dataframe, I rename the columns, filter out the non-values, and filter what are the columsn that I am trying to focus on. Finally, I have used streamlit to demosntrate my findings as it shows different rows and columsn that what I am trying to focus on (Carbohydrates, Protein, and fats)
If you could use streamlit, it should properly work well. I did not create tests at this time because it was not necessary, and I have run multile times on the streamlit. Please feel free to use streamlit to run the project and the 'run' button on the Vscode

### Other things you need to know
When I tried to convert the nutrition facts from Dominos, It was harder than I exected so I have ChatGPT to demonstrate on how I can convert PDF data to a better file with a a better format. Therefore, I have decided that I used Markdown as a way to load different rows and columsns from the Dominos's Nutrition fact. But then, I have proceded the same progress as other datasets across different fast food chains. Please let me know if you have any questions, so I can further clarify my codes.
